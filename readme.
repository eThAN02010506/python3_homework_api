The web contains data about possible fail rate for students in Gamedesign 3, using a~z as representation.

Using: /class_pass_chance/{participant_name}/fail_chance , will lead to the chance to fail and the student's name (a~z)
Using: /class_pass_chance/{participant_name}/age , will lead to the age and participant name
Using: "/class_pass_chance/info" will lead to introduction.
Note that, API_KEYS = ["060501", "060212"]
I named it api_key.

sample: http://0.0.0.0:8000/class_pass_chance/a/age?api_key=060212
